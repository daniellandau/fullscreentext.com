# fullscreentext.com

Want to show someone a short text with as large a font as possible? I thought surely this is something that is easily available as an app or something, but couldn't find anything in F-Droid. It's super easy to do on the web, so I just made it happen. Feel free to use [fullscreentext.com](https://fullscreentext.com) (no tracking) or just drop the index.html file from here anywhere where you host static html.
